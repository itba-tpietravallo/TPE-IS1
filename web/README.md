## Deployment

All commits to a branch will trigger a Github Action's workflow that'll build and push to Vercel's platform

Commits on the main branch will trigger production builds, while commits on other branches will trigger preview builds.

Github Actions use secrets corresponding to the `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, and `VERCEL_TOKEN` corresponding to @tomaspietravallo's account (please get in touch to debug the ci/cd pipeline). Secrets were set up on March 18th, 2025 with a 1 YEAR expiry.
