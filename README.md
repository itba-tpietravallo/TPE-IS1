# MatchPoint

[![Vercel Production Deployment](https://github.com/itba-tpietravallo/TPE-IS1/actions/workflows/vercel-deploy.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/itba-tpietravallo/TPE-IS1/actions/workflows/vercel-deploy.yaml)

This is the MatchPoint monorepo. This repository contains three main modules:
- web
- api
- mobile

## Web

Code under `/web/` uses Remix (React). Commits will trigger deployments to Vercel's platform.

Check [`/web/README.md`](/web/README.md) for instructions on how to build and develop.

## API

The API is generated by Remix [server functions](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/action) (`actions`, `loader`, `headers`, etc). These are found under `/web/app/routes/api/*` and symlinked for convincience at the root as `/api/`. Keep in mind this is a symlink. Commits made to `/api/` will reflect on the `/web/app/routes/api/` folder and trigger a deployment to Vercel.

## Mobile

The mobile app uses React Native with Expo. 

Check [`/mobile/README.md`](/mobile/README.md) for instructions on how to build and develop.
